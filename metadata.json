Then, you want to restart the service if either a new\nversion was installed, or the configuration file changed.\n\nIn your `providers/my_service_with_conf.rb` you would have:\n```ruby\naction :install do\n  notifying_action_wrapper\n    package 'my_service' do\n      action :install\n    end\n\n    template '/etc/my_service/config.yml'\n      source 'config.yml.erb'\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nYou will then be able to use this LWRP in recipes as follows:\n```ruby\n\nmy_cookbook_my_service_with_conf 'my_service1' do\n  action :install\n  notifies :restart, 'service[my_service]', :immediately\nend\n\nservice 'my_service' do\n  action :nothing\nend\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome.\n\n## License\n\nApache License 2.0\n",
